An interactive Life Care Hospital Dashboard built in Microsoft Excel to transform raw patient records into clear, actionable insights.📊​
This dashboard helps hospital teams to:

✅ Track patient admission status (admitted vs. not admitted) in real time

🎯 Monitor timeliness of care with the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Analyse patient demographics by age, gender, and race

🧭 Identify top department referrals (General Practice, Orthopaedics, Neurology, etc.) for better resource planning

🔍 Slice data by month and year using interactive filters and slicers
