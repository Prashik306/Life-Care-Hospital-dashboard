🏥 Life Care Hospital Dashboard – Excel Project
This project showcases an interactive Life Care Hospital Dashboard built in Microsoft Excel to analyse patient flow and experience.📊​​

Using pivot tables, charts and slicers, the dashboard tracks:

Admission status: admitted vs. not admitted patients to monitor utilisation.🚪​

Age distribution: patient volume by age group for better demographic insights.📈​

Timeliness of care: percentage of patients attended within 30 minutes to measure service efficiency.⏱️​

Gender analysis: male vs. female patient counts for balanced reporting.⚧️​

Department referrals: top‑referred departments (General Practice, Orthopaedics, Neurology, etc.) to support staffing and resource planning.🏥​

The dashboard is fully interactive with monthly slicers, allowing users to filter trends by time and instantly update all visuals for data‑driven decision‑making.🚀
